                <h3>Flowers</h3>
                <p>
                    Arrangement of flowers, arranging flowers or designing flowers is the art of creating flower arrangements in vases, bowls and baskets, or preparing flowers from flowers, weeds, decorative plants and other botanical materials. Usually the profession is related to working in a flower shop, and foreign arrangers are usually also flower sellers. However, there are those engaged in weaving flowers not as a profession, but as a hobby; 
                    And today it is also common to sell decorated bouquets in gas stations, supermarkets, nurseries and online flower stores. Florists need good eye contact so they can weave flowers without harming them, as well as understanding different types of flowers and their needs.
